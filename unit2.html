	<h1> My Perfect 10s  </h1>
  </header> 

	<p> The first thing you need to know about life around you is that you are always listing. It's never really silent. There
		will always be a noise wherever you go. Sound is all around us, constantly playing</p>

	<p> Sound is somehting almost every person in the world is able to experance. We all love certian sounds and enjoy listing	to them. Music is the sound of enjoyment for me. Music allows me to do so many things. It creates a chance for my mindto open up & get things done. Music is a huge part of my life. I play it everyday. These are just a few of my all time	perfect songs. </p>
